The most expensive movie yet made at the time and fraught with problems throughout the shoot, it was predicted for months to wind up a critical and commercial disaster. When people actually SAW the film, however, it was suddenly a very different situation. Titanic was a darling of most critics and audiences, a massive commercial splash(eventually becoming the highest grossing movie of all time and first to break the billion-dollar box office mark), won a record-tying 11 Oscars including Best Picture, and catapulted Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet to superstardom. Like most pop culture phenomena, it also prompted the proportional amount of backlash as well as quickly becoming a source of many Stock Parodies. Unadjusted for inflation, it's the now second-highest-grossing movie ever, beaten out by Cameron's own Avatar. (If you adjust for inflation, Titanic drops six slots, but even so it's still one of the highest-grossing films ever - the seventh, in fact!) In all likelihood, Cameron now has enough money to raise the Titanic and fire it toward Pandora."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In case you don't remember '97 or you were living in a cave at that time, Titanic tells the story, in Flash Back, of the two fictional Star-Crossed Lovers Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater.

There's also a Love Triangle involving Rose's evil Disposable Fianc\u00e9 Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley, who decides the best solution is to literally Murder the Hypotenuse, Jumping Off the Slippery Slope in the process.

She's also the blonde girl who hangs on the railing before falling to her death. The film's script identifies her as Helga Dahl (a name she indeed responds to in deleted scenes).

Kathy Bates's version is only a little more accurate than Debbie Reynolds's. Cameron stated his intention to portray her more accurately, and yet she was still referred to as Molly (a name she never went by when she was alive), tells the story of her husband accidentally lighting a match to money hidden in their stove (Leadville wasn't using paper money when the Browns lived there), and generally portrayed as a Fish Out of Water ex-hillbilly that the wealthy secretly resent (she was extremely well-read and generally liked by everyone she met). Brown had such a huge role in helping the Titanic survivors that one wonders why Cameron didn't focus on that rather than the many fabrications that have been told about her.","elements":[{"text":"Because Reality Is Unrealistic.

The weather was actually cloudy that day. The gigantic wave caused by Titanic's movement within the port overcame some of the piers and threatened to wash people away. The gigantic wake caused by the Titanic then caused another ship to break away from its moorings and drift dangerously close... so close that it missed the Titanic by mere inches.

The legend goes that some people saw that as an omen that the Titanic would never reach New York City and disembarked at the next stops.","elements":[]},{"text":"Astronomer Neil De Grasse Tyson pointed out to Cameron that the stars shown in one scene were wrong for the date and time the movie was set, because it was mirrored, resulting in identical sky halves.
